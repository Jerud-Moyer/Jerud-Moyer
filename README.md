### Hello!
#### My name is Jerud and I'm a fullstack software developer, musician and family man!
I love to code problems away and make the results *beautiful.*
Someday I'd really like to do more travelling and there are many home improvement challenges I'd like to tackle. I am an avid rider of motorcycles, preffering Yamahas and Suzukis. I'm a BBQ enthousiast and backyard *chef. I love spending time with my family and playing guitar.





#### *I am not a chef. Cook may be a better title.
